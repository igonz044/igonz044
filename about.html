            <h2 class="about-title">HI, I'M ITZEL</h2>
            <p>I am a <strong>Full-Stack</strong> developer and alumni from UC Riverside with a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science. I am passionate about building robust, end to end web solutions.</p>
            <p>My love for coding and design started working at my high school’s CUGR Press journalism team. My role was mainly using Adobe InDesign to do graphic design work for our weekly newspaper. However, I earned recognition for my adeptness in helping teammates with various computer-related issues. Because of this I landed my very first client, Mended Hearts of Ventura, for whom I crafted a website using WordPress. (I checked and it is still up, you can check it out here! 
            <a class="mended-hearts" href="https://mendedheartsventura.wordpress.com/">mendedheartsventura.wordpress.com</a>) After my daughter was born my excitement for web development was revitalized. I looked to further my skills and started by taking a course in Graphic Design through Coursera. </p>
            <p>Shortly after I landed a job as a Graphic Designer where I excelled and learned new workflows. I then started delving into the world of HTML, CSS, Javascript. I completed UX certification from <strong>Google</strong> as well, an experience I thoroughly enjoyed and that greatly enhanced my understanding of user-centric design principles.</p>
            <p>With my skills, I have been able to help multiple businesses in establishing an online presence, enabling them to reach and engage with their customers. Collaboration and communication are key to my process, ensuring that every project exceeds expectations.</p>
